# YangSTL

Yang's STL library learning project
Trying to DIY a small STL library myself!

Currently updated to the theoratical basis of computer memory.
Moving to DIY a `smart_ptr`
Wish me all the best!

## On schedule

| Project | brief | Percentage(estimated) |
| ------- | ----- | -------------------  |
| `smart_ptr` | smart pointer written by myself | $ 30\% $ |
| `allocator` | allocator for containers in STL | $ 10\% $ |
