# YangSTL

Yang's STL library learning project
Trying to DIY a small STL library myself!

Currently updated to the theoratical basis of computer memory.
Moving to DIY a `smart_ptr`
Wish me all the best!

## On schedule

| Project | brief | Percentage(estimated) |
| ------- | ----- | -------------------  |
| `smart_ptr` | smart pointers written by myself | 30% |
| `allocator` | allocators for containers in STL | 10% |
